Input from a file:

\inputminted[]{c}{../code/helloworld.c}

Single line: \mint{c}|char *a = "a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very string;"|

Don't set bgcolor, then mintinline works. 

Inline: \mintinline[bgcolor=gray]{c}|char *a = "a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very string;"|

Inline: \mintinline[]{c}|char *a = "a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very string;"|
